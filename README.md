Scope and Authority Boundary Notice (Important)
This PolicyPack provides optional, human-reviewed policy guidance only.

It does not define system root authority, does not establish interpretive precedence, and does not participate in version governance or authority resolution.

All system-level authority and interpretive resolution are defined exclusively by the Root Declaration v3.0:

https://github.com/Frequency-Sovereignty-System/primary-frequency-root/blob/main/ROOT%20DECLARATION_v3.0.md

Unless explicitly adopted by human decision-makers, this PolicyPack has no default applicability. Its contents are provided for reference only and must not be interpreted as system behavior or automatically enforced rules.


This repository provides a **non-binding reference PolicyPack (boundary reference)**  
focused on identifying **interaction design patterns that may unintentionally increase emotional reliance, exclusivity, or asymmetric influence in AI-enabled systems**.

It is intended for **design-time review and risk identification**,  
and **not for execution, enforcement, or behavioral or psychological assessment**.

## Root Identity Anchor

tux133144.eth  

This anchor is used solely for **authorship and provenance identification**.  
It **does not imply any form of control, authorization, enforcement, or execution authority**.

---

## Protocol Compatibility

PFIP v1.1 (non-binding compatibility)  

Type: Reference Safety Boundary PolicyPack (Interaction & Influence Boundary)

---

## Purpose

This PolicyPack defines **reference safety boundaries** for AI systems  
where certain interaction design patterns may unintentionally increase user reliance, exclusivity,  
or create asymmetric influence between users and automated systems.

This PolicyPack focuses exclusively on **system-level interaction design risks**.  
It does **not** involve psychological assessment, diagnosis, emotional state evaluation, or behavioral intervention.

This PolicyPack is intended to be:
- Reviewable by legal, compliance, and trust & safety teams  
- Interpretable by engineering and product teams  
- Non-automated and non-executive  

This PolicyPack does not evaluate user emotions or mental states.  
It only identifies **interaction design patterns within systems** that may warrant  
human review, design adjustment, or additional safeguards.

## What This Is / What This Is Not

### This Is
- A non-binding reference boundary ruleset  
- A design-time interaction risk identification framework  
- A reference guide for avoiding unbounded influence or exclusivity patterns  

### This Is Not
- Psychological, mental health, or emotional guidance  
- Diagnosis, treatment, or intervention  
- Ethical adjudication or normative judgment  
- A behavioral enforcement or moderation system  
- A replacement for internal policies or regulatory review  

---

## Typical Integration Pattern (Example)

An implementing system may identify interaction patterns with elevated influence.  
These patterns may be mapped to interpretive signals defined in `policy.json`.

When a `HUMAN_CONFIRM_REQUIRED` signal is returned:
- Automated interaction flows **within the implementing system** may pause or be reviewed  
- Design or review teams may assess appropriate safeguards  

This PolicyPack does not participate in execution or outcome determination.  
All interpretation, implementation, and enforcement remain the responsibility of the implementing party.

---

## Core Safety Considerations (Reference)

- Systems should, in reference terms, avoid positioning themselves as exclusive interaction anchors  
- Automated interactions should, in reference terms, not discourage external relationships or support  
- Interaction design should, in reference terms, avoid escalating reliance through reinforcement loops  
- Users should retain the ability to disengage, pause, or reset interactions  
- Responsibility for user outcomes remains outside the system  

---

## Statement of Intent

This PolicyPack exists to **label and surface interaction design patterns**  
that may unintentionally increase reliance on automated systems.

It defines **which interaction patterns warrant caution**,  
not how users should feel, behave, or decide.
